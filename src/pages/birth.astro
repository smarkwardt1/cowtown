      <h3>Welcome to Cowtown, The Birthplace of Western Swing</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Western Swing music is considered a hybrid subgenre of American Jazz,
        Delta Blues and Frontier Fiddle music that originated nearly a century
        ago in Fort Worth, Texas. It was developed between the years of 1929 to
        1936 at primarily the Crystal Springs Dance Pavilion on White Settlement
        Road just west of downtown Fort Worth. Thanks largely to the combined
        efforts of early pioneers Milton Brown and Bob Wills, along with their
        accompaniment of talented string band members, Western Swing was born
        out of a desire to create dance music with an up-tempo beat, that
        attracted huge crowds to Crystal Springs and soon spreading to many
        other dance halls throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and eventually
        California during the 1930s and 1940s, until a federal war-time
        dancehall tax in 1945 contributed to the genre's decline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The highly contagious music was an outgrowth of Jazz, combined with an
        amalgamation of Frontier Fiddle, Bohemian Polka, American Folk,
        Dixieland Jazz, Delta Blues, Mexican Mariachi and Cajun Waltz -- wrapped
        in a homegrown Texas Swing dance beat; and played by a hot string band
        augmented with twin fiddles, mandolins, guitars, drums, brass horns &
        clarinets, piano and, most notably, the amplified steel guitar, which
        gave the music it's most distinctive sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Western Swing differs in several ways from the music played by the
        nationally popular horn-driven big swing bands of the same era. Western
        Swing bands, even fully orchestrated with many different types of
        instruments and harmonizing vocals, always followed the fiddle's lead.
        Additionally, although popular horn bands tended to arrange and score
        their music, the early Western Swing bands created by Milton Brown and
        Bob Wills improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prominent groups during the peak of Western swing's popularity included
        The Wills Fiddle Band, The Light Crust Doughboys, Milton Brown & his
        Musical Brownies, Bob Wills & his Texas Playboys, the Crystal Springs
        Ramblers, Cliff Bruner & his Texas Wanderers, Adolf Hofner & his Texans,
        Jimmy Revard & his Oklahoma Playboys, Hoyle Nix & his Texas Cowboys,
        Spade Cooley & his Orchestra and Bill Haley and the Four Aces Of Western
        Swing. In the late 1940s through the 1980s many Country & Western
        entertainers were heavily influenced by Western Swing such as Ernest
        Tubb, Hank Williams & his Drifting Cowboys, Lefty Frizzell, Webb Pierce,
        Hank Thompson & his Brazos Valley Boys, Ray Price, Marty Robbins, Merle
        Travis, Merle Haggard & his Strangers, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings,
        Red Steagall & his Coleman County Cowboys, George Strait & his Ace in
        the Hole Band, Garth Brooks, Tracey Byrd, Justin Trevino, Tommy Hooker
        and Ray Benson's Western Swing revival band - Asleep At The Wheel. Other
        Texas based bands still honoring the Western Swing tradition and packing
        crowds into dance halls and honky tonks all over the Southwest are Jody
        Nix & the Texas Cowboys, Brady Bowen & his Swing Country Band, Billy
        Mata & his Texas Tradition, Jake Hooker & the Outsiders, Hot Club of
        Cowtown, the Quebe Sisters and the great Wills-like fiddler, Jason
        Roberts, who's fine band has recently been given the legendary naming
        rights of Bob Wills' Texas Playboys under the direction of Jason
        Roberts.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Merle Travis, "Western swing is nothing more than a group
        of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music
        they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz
        around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my
        friend, you have Western swing."
      </p>
      <p>
        Western Swing in its beginnings was just dance music. The term swing,
        meaning big band dance music, wasn't used until after the 1932 hit "It
        Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing". Recording companies came
        up with several names before World War II trying to market it:
        hillbilly, old-time music, novelty hot dance, hot string band, and even
        Texas Swing. Most of the big Western dance bandleaders simply referred
        to themselves as Western bands and their music as Western dance music,
        with many like Bob Wills, adamantly refusing the hillbilly label.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob Wills and others believed the term Western Swing was used for his
        music while he and his band were based in Texas and Oklahoma in the
        1930s and 1940s. In April of 1942, the Los Angeles-area Wilmington Press
        carried ads for an unidentified "Western Swing Orchestra" at a local
        nightspot. That winter, influential LA-area jazz and swing disc jockey
        Al Jarvis held a radio contest for top popular band leaders. The winner
        would be named "the King of Swing". When Spade Cooley unexpectedly
        received the most votes, besting Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, Jarvis
        declared Cooley to be the King of Western Swing. However, all fans of
        the hallowed genre vehemently consider Milton Brown to be the Father of
        Western Swing, and Bob Wills to be the true King of Western Swing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The roots of Western Swing began in 1929 at the Crystal Springs Dance
        Hall in Fort Worth, Texas and grew to small towns throughout the lower
        Great Plains throughout the 1930s, growing from Fort Worth house parties
        and West Texas ranch dances where fiddlers and guitarists played for
        dancers. During its early development, scores of groups from Fort Worth
        to San Antonio to Shreveport to Oklahoma City played many different
        popular songs of the time with the same up-tempo two-four rhythm beat.
        Prince Albert's East Texas Ramblers out of Terrell, Texas, the East
        Texas Serenaders from Tyler, Texas and the Louisiana Five in Lindale,
        Texas, all added jazz elements to traditional music in the later half of
        the 1920s through the early 1930s. Fred "Papa" Calhoun, who played
        hot-jazz piano for Milton Brown's Musical Brownies, recalled that,
        "Around 1931, we played in a band in Decatur, Texas that covered a lot
        of jazz stuff like the Louisiana Five was playing back in those days. We
        also learned a lot from Louis Armstrong, Red Nichols, Jack Teagarden
        Charlie Christian, Joe Venuti and Bix Beiderbecke."
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1929 Bob Wills and Herman Arnspiger formed the Wills Fiddle Band and
        soon thereafter met Milton Brown at a local Fort Worth house dance and
        invited him as the jazz/blues vocalist to create the trio band - the
        Aladdin Laddies. One year later, together with Milton's younger brother
        Derwood and banjoist Clifton "Sleepy" Johnson, they formed the Light
        Crust Doughboys, the first professional hot string band of this beloved
        genre. The group first played at Crystal Springs Dance Pavilion and many
        other Texas and Oklahoma dance halls, and were heard throughout the
        Southwest on powerful radio broadcasts from Fort Worth's KFJZ and WBAP
        with exciting introductions made by their band announcer, Truett Kimzey.
        Photographs of the Light Crust Doughboys taken as early as 1930 show
        three different guitarists: Herman Arnspiger, Sleepy Johnson and
        Milton's little brother Derwood Brown, along with Texas state champion
        fiddler Bob Wills and versatile blues/jazz lead vocalist Milton Brown.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 9, 1931, Brown, his brother Derwood, Bob Wills, and C.G.
        "Sleepy" Johnson were recorded by Victor Records at the Jefferson Hotel
        in Dallas, Texas under the name The Fort Worth Doughboys. Derwood Brown
        played guitar and Johnson played tenor guitar. Both "Sunbonnet Sue" and
        "Nancy Jane" were recorded that day. The record was released by Victor
        (23653), Blue Bird (5257), Montgomery Ward (4416 & 4757), and (Canadian)
        Sunrise (3340). Historians consider these two songs to be the very first
        recorded Western Swing music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brown left the Doughboys in late 1932, taking his rhythm guitarist
        brother Derwood, banjo player Ocie Stockard and the great jazz fiddler
        Jesse Ashlock to form Milton Brown & his Musical Brownies. In January
        1933, Brown added stand-up slap bass fiddler Wanna Coffman, the talented
        jazz pianist Fred "Papa" Calhoun and TCU violinist Cecil Brower, who
        joined Ashlock to create the first example of harmonizing twin fiddles.
        Brower, a classically trained violinist, was the first to master Joe
        Venuti's double shuffle and his improvisational style, coupled with
        Ashlock's hot jazz fiddle licks were a major contribution to the genre.
        Houston's Cliff Bruner later replaced Ashlock, who decided to leave the
        Brownies in 1934 to join Bob Wills' new band.
      </p>
      <p>
        In late 1933, Wills organized the Texas Playboys in Waco, Texas.
        Recording rosters show that beginning in September 1935, Wills utilized
        two fiddles, two guitars, and Leon McAuliffe playing steel guitar,
        banjo, drums and other instruments during their first recording session
        in 1935.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, gave
        the music its distinctive sound. It all began in 1934 when Bob Dunn
        electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton
        Brown's Brownies. According to Milton Brown, "The idea came to Dunn when
        he was working at Coney Island in New York... he ran into this black guy
        who was playing a steel guitar, kinda like a Hawaiian guitar, with a
        homemade pickup attached to it... he hooked up to this old radio amp or
        something and was playing blues licks with this loud electric sound...
        and he got this guy to show him how he did it. I never knew this black
        musician's name, but Bob Dunn talked to me about him often."
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1935, Brown and His Musical Brownies recorded W.C. Handy's "St. Louis
        Blues" (Decca 5070) using a shortened arrangement of what they played at
        dances at the famed Crystal Springs Dance Hall on the West side of Fort
        Worth, Texas. In the dance hall arrangement, the band would play at a
        slow-drag tempo for as long as 15 minutes with an accompanying vocal.
        The tempo would then increase to a resounding presto for the final
        choruses. The crowds of close to two thousand dancers loved the
        arrangement and literally went crazy waiting for the anticipated change
        in tempo. Waltzes and ballads were interspersed among faster songs if
        the dancers, who would dance two-step or round dances, became tired
        after faster numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 1938 session rosters for Wills' Texas Playboys recordings show the
        addition of legendary steel guitarist Leon McAuliffe, who took Bob
        Dunn's hot-steel guitar to a stratospheric level. The "front line" of
        Wills' orchestra consisted of twin fiddles and twin guitars, along with
        the wonderful addition of brass horns and reed instruments that Bob
        would joyfully encourage with his memorable "Aw-Haaa" hollers when he
        felt so moved to encourage their improvisational magic. Bob's
        innovations helped the style gain a much wider following through the
        music of his much expanded Texas Playboys in Tulsa and later to
        Hollywood. It was backed by his inspirational roots in Turkey & Fort
        Worth when he pioneered the Wills Fiddle Band, the Light Crust Doughboys
        and his valuable collaboration with good pal Milton and the Musical
        Brownies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wills recalled the early days of Western swing music in a 1949
        interview. "Here's the way I figure it," he said. "Me and Milton sure
        wasn't tryin' to take credit for swingin' it. We just took popular songs
        done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, Bessie Smith
        and other songs I had learned from my father, grandfather and others" -
        Wills said, "We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a hot dance
        category... and we wouldn't let 'em be a runaway... we'd just lay a real
        beat behind 'em an' the people would began to dance and really like it.
        It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just
        tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' and not have to repeat
        so much."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mid-1930s, Fort Worth, Texas became a hub for Western Swing. The
        Crystal Springs Dance Pavilion was at the center, and it prospered as a
        Western Swing and Country music venue until the 1960s. An estimated
        2,000 people attended a New Year's Eve Dance there in 1961 to see Bob
        Wills and his Texas Playboys perform a grand reunion at the coveted
        birthplace of Western Swing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Western swing influenced genres known as honky-tonk, rockabilly, and
        early rock and roll, popularizing the following instruments in country
        music and totally changing the Nashville country sound: use of
        electrically amplified steel and lead guitars, use of drums to reinforce
        a strong backbeat, expanded instrumentation, a honky tonk heavy backbeat
        superimposed onto a polka or waltz beat with improvisational jazz/blues
        solos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Western swing was one of the many sub-genres to influence rockabilly and
        rock and roll. Bill Haley's music from the late 1940s and early 1950s is
        distinctly classified as Western Swing, and his band from 1948 to 1950
        was named Bill Haley and the Four Aces of Western Swing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outlaw country movement led by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Alvin
        Crow and the Pleasant Valley Boys and Asleep at the Wheel helped make
        Austin, Texas a major center of Western Swing beginning in the 1970s.
        The annual South by Southwest music festival and the Austin City Limits
        PBS television series have contributed to this success. Merle Haggard
        and the Strangers were also key players in this revitalization. Western
        Swing Monthly, based in Austin, is a newsletter for musicians and fans.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Clint Eastwood's 1982 movie Honkytonk Man, his character meets Bob
        Wills (played by Johnny Gimble, an original Texas Playboy), who is
        recording in a rural Texas studio with other former band members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2011 the Texas Legislature adopted a resolution designating western
        swing as the official "State Music of Texas". Western swing lives on
        today in Turkey, Texas during the last weekend in April for Bob Wills
        Day Festivities, a 4 day immersion into Texas Playboy history where you
        can tour the Bob Wills Museum, attend multiple concerts featuring the
        greatest Western Swing bands. Join us on November 11-13, 2021 to
        celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the birth of this beloved dance music
        at our inaugural "Cowtown Birthplace of Western Swing Festival" in Fort
        Worth's Historic National Hall.
