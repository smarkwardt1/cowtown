    bio: "<p>It is with great pride we announce Paula Jungmann as the latest addition to our CBWS Board of Advisors. Paula has been a towering figure in the western swing world, from her groundbreaking Texas legislative accomplishments to her innovative social media marketing for the dance music we all love.</p><p>Paula is a native Texan who grew up in San Antonio, home of the Alamo. She now resides with her husband in the nearby Texas Hill Country community of Boerne. Her mother's family were pioneers of Blanco County, having moved there prior to the Civil War. Her maternal grandfather was a rancher who also played fiddle for community gatherings, as well as preaching for traveling tent revivals who frequented his ranch.</p><p>Paula's love of music was from an early age. She loved the beat that had led her to dance. Early on she went to dances with her parents and would be drug around the dance floor by her older brother to the music of Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell playing on the jukebox. Fast forward to her early teens, rock & roll was on rise, and of course there again was that BEAT... she just had to dance. At age 14 she met the young man who would become her husband. He was also raised on country music and began taking her to country dances. Country music was a bit too much twang for her, until George Jones came out with the face paced <q>White Lightning</q> and <q>The Race Is On</q>... she was hooked on country music from then on.</p><p>Western Swing came to her heart much later. She of course heard it and danced to it, but didn't have much experience with it until a local area band began playing this contagious Cowboy Jazz dance music at a hall she frequented. The music again had that unmistakable BEAT, and called her to the dance floor. She absolutely fell in love with it. But she noticed this wonderful band wasn't drawing much of a crowd, WHY? It wasn't that the band didn't play it well. There had to be another reason. Time and time again, the crowd wasn't there. So she started looking for ways to raise awareness to others to discover this wonderful rebirth of Texas born Western Swing music. As time went by, Paula found a couple of other bands who played this contagious music. After trying all sorts of things, from inviting strangers to her table to throwing get togethers at her home, she came upon a bold idea of bringing Western Swing to a statewide audience of recognition. She would seek and eventually secure a Texas State Senate concurrent resolution to officially recognize the genre. In 2008 she began writing her state representatives to make a strong case for Western Swing to become the Official State Music of Texas. Through a grueling effort of trial and error and lobbying with multiple Representatives and Senators, she persevered and achieved success in May of 2011, when the Texas State Senate, led by Senator Jeff Wentworth, voted Western Swing the Official State Music of Texas. The House passed the resolution 3 weeks later, led by Rep. Doug Miller, who in celebration actually went to the podium to sing a western swing tune! Governor Rick Perry signed the concurrent resolution on June 17, 2011. Thanks to Paula's unrelenting effort, Western Swing Music is now a certified symbol of Texas culture, just as the bluebonnet flower and other wonderful symbols and traditions have made our Lone Star State uniquely Texas.</p><p>Paula is the founder and administrator of the immensely popular Western Swing Music of Texas Facebook page and group. At this writing, there are over 19,000 combined followers who come to Paula's group page to discover and enjoy this great music; and find out who, what and where western swing events are happening. The page utilizes YouTube videos, event posters and band event postings to engage the audience; and also mixes historical and educational content so people will understand the genre's monumental importance. Paula has strived to make the group page not only a symbol of the music, but a working platform that helps keep the music alive and draw interested dancers to the Official Music of Texas. It is no wonder that she has been humbled, privileged and honored to be inducted into the Cowtown Society of Western Music Hall of Fame, the Western Swing Society of the Southwest Hall of Fame, the Northwest Western Swing Hall of Fame and the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame.</p>",
